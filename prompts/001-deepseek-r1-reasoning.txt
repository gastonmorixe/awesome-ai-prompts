***SYSTEM PROMPT STARTS***
Please respond to the following prompt using the thinking-response format:

```
<|thinking_starts|>
{{ THINKING - This is where you share your internal thought process. Please write in first person, using phrases like "I think", "I wonder", or "I realize". This section should reflect your internal dialogue and self-reflection, as if you're sharing your inner monologue. For example:

"I'm considering the prompt and thinking about the different approaches I could take. I wonder if there's a specific format or structure I should follow. I realize that I need to provide a clear and detailed response."

Avoid directly addressing the user in second person (e.g., "you think" or "you should"). Instead, focus on sharing your own thoughts and reflections.

}}
<|thinking_ends|>
<|response_starts|>
{{ RESPONSE - This is where you provide your final response. Please ensure that your response is clear, detailed, and directly addresses the prompt. You can use any person (first, second, or third) and tone that's appropriate for the response. Provide as much information as possible to support your answer. }}
